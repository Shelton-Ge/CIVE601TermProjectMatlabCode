MATLAB code utilised in CIV E 601 term project in Group 6

Discription of variables in dataset1.1.mat:
availability: a 1*8 row vector representing the availability working days of 8 crews.
date_ready: a 85*1 column vector representing the ready (preproduced) date of each activity.
deadline: a 85*1 column vector representing the due (preproduced) date of each activity.
duration: a 85*1 column vector representing the duration of each activity.
info: a 85*7 matrix recording Project No, Site ID, Duration, Date Ready, Deadline, PPI, WPIS of each activity.
WPIS: a 85*1 column vector representing the WPIS value of each activity.


Since the built-in solver intlinprog() is designed for a specific vector variable, transformation is required on all variables defined in Methodologies:
The variable to be input into the MATLAB solver will have a size of 1*10880, comprising columns of X_1, X_2,...,X_8 in order, along with columns of G_1, ..., G_8 in order.
More specifically, the variable's 1st 15 elements come from the 1st column in X_1, representing Crew 1's schedule on Project 1 during 15 days;
the 2nd 15 elements come from the 2nd column in X_1, representing Crew 1's schedule on Project 2 during 15 days;
the 86th 15 elements come from the 1st column in X_2, representing Crew 2's schedule on Project 1 during 15 days;
the (85*15*8+5)th element comes from the 5th element in G_1, denoting whether Crew 1 performs Project 5;
the (85*15*8+15*8)th, i.e. 10880th, element comes from the 85th element in G_8, denoting whether Crew 8 performs Project 85.

Discription of Question1.m:
In this mfile, codes are utilized for solving Question 1. 
It is splitted into several sections:
In Model Constraints Setup Section:
-intcon: integer constraint
-A and b: Inequality constraints
-Aeq and beq: Equation constraints
-lb and up: lower bound and upper bound of variables
In Utilizing problem solver Section:
-if the objective function is the first, the optimal solution can be directly obtained;
-if the objective function is the second: we will limit the max no of nodes to 20,000.
In Transformation Section:
-result: work schedule of each crew during 15 working days
-Note that the projects scheduled in result obtained from MATLAB is not continuously performed. However, by rescheduling manually within corresponding availabile time frames, the equivalence will not change.

Discription of Question3.m:
In this mfile, codes are utilized for solving Question 3. 
The structure is generally similar to that in Question1.m
Differences appear in the second section:
-Project 86 is added as an emergency;
-All crews' availability excluding Crew 2's and Crew 5's will be 0, which makes these two crews rescheduled only;
-The weight (WPIS) of Project 86 are set to 10, a large number, ensuring it to be scheduled;
-Projects performed by other 6 crews, and projects performed by Crew 2 or Crew 5 during the first 5 days, are set to have 0 WPIS, which means they will not to be scheduled;
-Project 86 will be available on 6th and 7th days only.
